The Odin Project: Etch-a-sketch project

This is the Etch-a-sketch project from The Odin Project course. The assignment is to make a web page where the user can interact with a part of the page and "draw" on it by changing the background color of the hovered elements, similar to a drawing board or a etch-a-sketch board. The user can change the size of the board.

The project showcases basic methods for DOM manipulation and events.
